 * Owns the follow-up debt created by a decision epoch advance that happened

 *
 * Two writers advance `updated_at_ms` from outside settlement: a user PATCH,
 * and the breaker reset that every explicit user Turn commits. Either write
 * invalidates the running Turn's binding — its settlement stops at the stale
 * stage, before continuation — cancels the follow-up already sitting in the
 * Queue, and misses the write-back CAS of any verifier verdict still in flight,
 * while neither can schedule a replacement itself (`maybeKick` bails on a busy
 * session, successful objective steering returns before it, and the breaker
 * reset is a bare store write that publishes no lifecycle event at all). A
 * stale-cancelled Queue item produces no settlement of its own either, so it
 * cannot be relied on to wake the Goal.
 *
 * So the write that advanced the epoch arms a marker here, and the next
 * settlement on that session drains it, rebuilding the follow-up from durable
 * state at the *current* epoch.
 *
 * That makes this list an invariant, not an inventory: **a writer that advances
 * the decision epoch must take over the Goal's next step — by scheduling it, or
 * by arming a marker here. A writer that takes over nothing must not advance
 * it.** `bumpThreadGoalBoundUsage` is the boundary case that proves it: a stale
 * charge records real spend but decides nothing, so it keeps the epoch instead
 * of joining this list (see `store-bound-settlement.ts`). A future writer that
 * cannot keep the epoch belongs here.

   * than as an `active` continuation: the epoch advance made the queued kickoff
   * stale, and only the kickoff carries the one-shot attachment snapshot.

   * Duplication semantics are deliberately at-least-once, not exactly-once. The
   * marker is claimed synchronously (read and delete with no `await` between),
   * so two concurrent drains cannot both own it, and a failed drain re-arms only
   * when no newer writer has claimed the slot. Across a crash the in-memory
   * marker is lost and startup recovery is the backstop. A duplicate follow-up
   * costs one extra admission, which `finalRecheck` resolves; a lost one strands
