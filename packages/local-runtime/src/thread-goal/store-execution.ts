/**
 * Durable "why is this Goal not running" projection.
 *
 * Three rules make these writes safe to issue from admission, which runs on the
 * hot queue path:
 *
 *  - They never touch `updated_at_ms`. That column is the Turn admission
 *    decision epoch; advancing it merely to publish a wait would invalidate the
 *    very kickoff we are explaining.
 *  - They are guarded by that same epoch plus `status = 'active'`, so a
 *    decision computed against a Goal that has since moved on is dropped
 *    instead of resurrecting a stale reason.
 *  - They stamp the epoch they were decided against into
 *    `execution_wait_epoch`. `rowToThreadGoalState` only surfaces a wait whose
 *    epoch still matches `updated_at_ms`, so this module is the *only* place
 *    that has to know these columns exist: every other writer retires the wait
 *    simply by advancing the epoch, and a future one cannot forget to.
 *
 * Both helpers return `undefined` when nothing changed — including the common
 * case of re-observing the same blocker on every drain — so callers can skip
 * publishing a redundant update event and the UI's wait timer keeps counting
 * from the original `sinceMs`.
