 * The staleness predicate for everything bound to a `GoalTurnBinding`.

 * work lands, checked in this order because each later check is only meaningful
 * once the earlier one holds:
 *
 * 1. `missing_goal` — the row is gone (deleted mid-Turn).
 * 2. `goal_epoch` — the CAS epoch moved; another decision won the race.
 * 3. `objective_digest` — the objective was rewritten, so the work answered a
 *    question nobody is asking any more.
 * 4. `goal_status` — the Goal already left `active`.
 *
 * Accounting deliberately stops after check 3 — see
