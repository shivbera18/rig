/**
 * Output-review event writer: The local review-before-release boundary.
 *
 * agent-core continuously emits stream.resp containing user-visible text/thinking chunks and
 * nontext chunks such as finish/tool-call. Text requires safety review; nontext does not, but must
 * retain producer order in SSE instead of overtaking earlier text.
 *
 * Maintain one pendingQueue:
 * 1. Enqueue every stream.resp in agent-core producer order.
 * 2. Mark text/thinking unreleasable until its review window passes.
 * 3. finish / first tool-call marks a streaming phase boundary: settle the remaining short text
 *   window before making that boundary chunk releasable. Other nontext chunks simply wait in the
 *   queue.
 * 4. Review the complete final AgentMessage again, then release its event in original order.
 *
 * The goal is to preserve agent-core's chunk_index / producer order for upstream SSE while never
 * leaking unapproved content to the UI.
 *
 * Both failure exits set flags and discard unsent content without throwing: pi's event loop
 * swallows writer exceptions, so throwing cannot reliably drive follow-up behavior.
 * - Content verdict rejected → set {@link blocked}; the host retracts and regenerates.
 * - Safety API local_error retries exhausted → set {@link networkStopped}; the host preserves
 *   approved content and shows a network notice without retracting user input.
 * The host reads both flags after runTurn resolves; these are the reliable blocking signals.
