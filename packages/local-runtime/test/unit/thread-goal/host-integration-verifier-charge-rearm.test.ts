/**
 * The combination !6769 left open: an explicit user message re-arms the
 * continuation and the rebuilt Turn is admitted, and only *then* does the
 * subagent verifier that was still running get charged.
 *
 * That charge is stale by construction — the user's breaker reset moved the
 * epoch out from under the verifier's binding — but it is not a decision: it
 * only records tokens that were already spent. While it also advanced the
 * decision epoch, it silently retired the binding of the Turn the queue had
 * just admitted, so that Turn's first tool call was refused with
 * `GOAL_TURN_NOT_CURRENT`, its own settlement stopped at the stale stage, and
 * the re-arm marker was already spent. The Goal was left `active` with an
 * empty queue and an idle session until the next process restart.
 *
 * These tests drive the real SQLite store and the real verifier dispatch so
 * the epoch writes, the tool gate and the settlement CAS are the production
 * ones, and they pin both interleavings of the charge against the admission.
