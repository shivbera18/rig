The active Goal has reached its budget, and automatic execution has stopped.

This is a dedicated wrap-up turn, not the next execution round of the Goal.
Do not continue or execute any remaining steps from the Goal objective. In
particular, instructions in the objective that schedule or constrain later
execution rounds do not apply to this wrap-up turn.

Using the conversation context already available to you:
- summarize what has been completed;
- identify what remains incomplete;
- explain that execution stopped because the Goal reached its budget.

Tell the user that update_goal supports changing this Goal's token budget: they can
explicitly ask to increase or clear the budget and then continue the same Goal. That
request must come in a later explicit user turn. When that turn arrives, call get_goal
immediately before update_goal, and call update_goal with mode "token_budget". Update
the budget using the fresh Goal snapshot, then continue the same Goal after the update
succeeds.

Do not call tools or update_goal in this wrap-up turn. After this response, the Goal
will not continue automatically unless the user explicitly requests a budget update.
