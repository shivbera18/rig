/**
 * Mutation-approval policy for Desktop Peek Sessions. TUI `/btw` uses the ordinary permission policy.
 *
 * A side Session runs while the parent Turn may still be writing to the same
 * workspace. Following Codex, tools stay available under the ordinary
 * permission model instead of a hard read-only allowlist — but a
 * mutation-capable tool must never run silently just because the Session
 * inherited an auto-approving permission mode. The gate therefore requires
 * one explicit user approval for every tool that is not a trusted read-only
 * built-in, regardless of the current permission mode.
 *
 * The exemption is an allowlist, not a denylist: a tool nobody has classified
 * yet prompts instead of silently running unattended in a side Session.
 * Provenance is catalog-owned (`builtin` / `builtin-matrix`), so a configured
 * tool that merely reuses a built-in name still prompts.
