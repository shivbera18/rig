/**
 * Thread Goal continuation orchestrator — wraps the host's per-turn
 * `runOneTurn` callable in a `while goal.status === 'active'` loop so
 * the model can keep working across turns without the user having to
 * keep typing prompts.
 *
 * Lifecycle in one SSE stream:
 *   1. user message arrives, host pre-buffers `userMessages` into the
 *      writer (so the UI sees the message immediately).
 *   2. orchestrator runs turn #1 with the user-typed content.
 *   3. After the turn returns, orchestrator reads the goal state.
 *      - status === 'active'        → render continuation prompt,
 *                                     new turnId, loop.
 *      - status in {complete,
 *                   blocked,
 *                   paused}         → break.
 *      - no goal exists for session → break.
 *      - turn status === 'error'    → mark goal blocked (if one exists)
 *                                     and break (codex on_turn_error parity).
 *      - turn status === 'aborted' /
 *        signal aborted             → break WITHOUT blocking. A turn abort
 *                                     (user cancel OR the objective-edit
 *                                     restart) leaves the goal `active` —
 *                                     codex `on_turn_abort` only accounts
 *                                     progress, it never blocks. Blocking
 *                                     here was the bug that left an edited
 *                                     goal stuck on `blocked`.
 *      - turn status ===
 *        'waiting_for_user'          → break WITHOUT blocking. ask_user has
 *                                     created a pending questionnaire; the
 *                                     answer path will kick the next turn.
 *      - turn status === 'retracted' → atomically pause the active goal,
 *                                     publish the updated goal, and break.
 *   4. Caller writes `[DONE]` and closes the writer.
 *
 * This legacy loop observes only durable Goal state. The hosted v2 path owns
 * `update_goal` proposals and settles them before any continuation decision;
 * this helper has no independent proposal authority.
 *
 * **No max-turn limit**, no token budget — codex Thread Goal alignment.
 * Safety nets: (a) `signal.aborted` short-circuits the loop,
 * (b) `update_goal(blocked)` lets the model self-stop, (c) UI `/goal
 * pause` flips status → paused, (d) UI `/goal clear` DELETE flips
 * status by removing the row.
