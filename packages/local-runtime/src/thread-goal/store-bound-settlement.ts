/**
 * Attribute one admitted Turn and make any budget stop in the same short
 * transaction.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry with `settleThreadGoalBoundTurn` below: this operation
 * writes the usage **even when the binding is stale**, and reports the reason
 * alongside the write instead of refusing it. Consumption already happened —
 * the tokens were spent and the wall clock ran regardless of what the row now
 * says — so dropping the write would let a Goal spend real budget for free
 * every time an objective edit or a concurrent decision landed mid-Turn, which
 * is the one failure the three-dimension budget exists to prevent. Decisions
 * are still refused: `settlementStage2ClassifyStale` reads `staleReason` off
 * this result and hard-stops before any decision is derived from it.
 *
 * The same asymmetry applies to `updated_at_ms`. Consumption is a fact about
 * the Goal; the decision epoch is the token for who owns its next step. A
 * charge only advances the epoch when it actually makes a decision — a budget
 * crossing — so a stale charge records the spend and leaves the Goal's current
 * runner alone.

     *    the Goal with no runner at all (the re-arm marker is already spent).
