/**
 * Every explicit user Turn commits a breaker reset, and that reset advances the
 * Goal decision epoch. Like a user PATCH, one write invalidates every runner the
 * Goal had at once:
 *
 *   1. the running bound Turn's binding, so its settlement stops at the stale
 *      stage and never reaches stage 10,
 *   2. the post-turn continuation already queued at the old epoch
 *      (`classifyQueuedItem` -> 'cancel'), and
 *   3. any verifier verdict still in flight, whose write-back CAS now misses.
 *
 * Unlike PATCH, nothing downstream of the reset even observes it: it is a bare
 * store write that publishes an SSE `updated` event, not the internal lifecycle
 * event `maybeKick` listens on. Before this fix an `active` Goal was therefore
 * left with no source of further execution the moment its user typed anything,
 * which is what stranded the reported sessions.
 *
 * These tests drive the real SQLite store so the epoch bump, the staleness
 * predicate and the queue classification are the production ones, and they pin
 * who owns the follow-up in each way a user Turn can end: it settles normally,
 * it never starts at all, its Goal is no longer continuable, or a second writer
 * races the drain.
