/**
 * Unified platform adapter contract for the local-runtime channel layer.
 *
 * Every concrete IM platform (Telegram / Feishu / WeChat / mock) is expected to
 * eventually expose a `LocalChannelPlatformAdapter`. The adapter owns the
 * platform-specific edges — credential binding, inbound normalization, outbound
 * delivery, and attachment resolution — so the runner and infra layers stay
 * platform-agnostic.
 *
 * This file is intentionally type-only: it defines the contract that MR-B/C/D
 * implement against. No platform SDK is imported here.
 *
 * Media is modelled with the canonical `OutboundMediaRef` from `@rig/shared`
 * (the same value object the UI's DeliverAssetsCard and `parseMediaTags`
 * produce) so the IM outbound surface never drifts from the UI on what counts
 * as a deliverable asset. The interactive `ask_user` round-trip rides as an
 * optional `questionnaire` field on `ChannelOutboundMessageInput` — only
 * adapters that can render structured interactive UI (Feishu card today) act
 * on it; the others ignore it and the platform-agnostic
 * {@link LocalChannelQuestionnaireBridge} owns the lifecycle / submit decode.
 */

 * Platform-agnostic questionnaire payload that an outbound channel message can
 * carry. Re-uses {@link AskQuestionnaireRequest} verbatim — the same value
 * object the UI composer renders — so the runtime never has to translate
 * between two questionnaire shapes. Adapters that render structured UI
 * (Feishu card) consume this; adapters that only render text (Telegram /
 * WeChat) either format a numbered fallback or ignore the payload.

 * interactive form (card on Feishu, numbered text elsewhere) instead of (or
 * alongside) the plain text body. Adapters MUST treat all three of `text`,
