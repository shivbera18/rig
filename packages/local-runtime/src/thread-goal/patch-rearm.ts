/**
 * Arm condition for the explicit-user-turn breaker reset.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* {@link shouldArmUserPatchRearm}. That predicate reads the
 * session's live execution facts (`isSessionBusy`, the bound Turn behind an
 * `enqueued` kickoff) because a user PATCH arrives asynchronously and has to
 * decide whether the Queue or `maybeKick` already owns the follow-up. The
 * breaker reset commits from inside the admission of the explicit user Turn
 * itself, where those facts are not yet true and not reliable: the Turn that is
 * about to run has not started, so the session can still read idle, and the
 * kickoff item is being dequeued right now.
 *
 * The condition that *is* reliable there is the CAS outcome. A successful
 * `resetBreakerAtEpoch` advances the decision epoch, which by construction
 * invalidates every runner the Goal had — the running bound Turn's binding, the
 * queued follow-up, and any verifier verdict still in flight. So a reset that
 * actually landed on a continuable Goal always leaves that Goal without a
 * runner, and always owes it a replacement.
