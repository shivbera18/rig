/**
 * Cross-fix combination coverage for the consolidated Goal MR.
 *
 * Each of the four fixes is already covered on its own source branch. What no
 * single branch could cover is the behaviour that only exists once they sit in
 * the same tree, because each one changed a touchpoint the others also use:
 *
 *   - the explicit-user-Turn breaker reset (M1) now also has to clear the
 *     no-tool counter (M3), and its re-arm has to survive an epoch that the
 *     breaker itself may have moved,
 *   - the breaker writes and advances the epoch at stage 8 (M3), which is
 *     exactly the epoch the re-arm generation guard (M1) compares against,
 *   - a verification wait (M2) is projected without advancing the epoch, so it
 *     must leave the breaker counters and the re-arm alone,
 *   - a dependency wait clears the streak before it enqueues the deferable
 *     continuation (M3), which is the ordering the Queue-local exclusion (M6)
 *     relies on to keep the deferred item while user work overtakes it.
 *
 * These drive the real SQLite store, so the epoch bumps, the breaker CAS and
 * the queue classification are the production ones rather than mocks.
