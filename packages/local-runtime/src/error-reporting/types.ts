/**
 * Public types and tunable options for desktop error-log reporting.
 *
 * Provides generic error reporting for local-runtime. Physical LLM provider request failures are
 * the first consumer, but event types are unrestricted so other subsystems can reuse the pipeline.
 *
 * Constraints (technical design "Rig desktop error-log batch reporting"):
 * - Must stay in packages/local-runtime; do not move to packages/shared or depend on apps/electron.
 * - Memory only: no disk, SQLite, outbox, or dataDir cache.
 * - Reporting failures must not affect LLM requests, automatic retries, or turn results.
 * - `event_log` must be minimized before buffering; encryption is an additional transport layer.
 *   Use AES-256-GCM (see ./crypto.ts).
