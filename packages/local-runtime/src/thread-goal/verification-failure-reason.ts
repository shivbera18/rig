/**
 * Map a verifier dispatch failure onto the status reason that names its *owner*.
 *
 * Every failure pauses — the Goal is never advanced on an unproven verdict — so
 * the only free variable is the reason, and the reason is the whole diagnostic
 * value. Collapsing 12 codes into `paused(verifier_unavailable)` means a
 * production pause tells an on-call engineer nothing about which layer to open:
 * a leaked API key, a prompt that outgrew the context window, a crashed child,
 * and a workspace edited mid-verification all read identically.
 *
 * The grouping is deliberately coarser than the code set: it is keyed on *who
 * fixes it*, not on what threw. Two codes with the same owner share a reason so
 * the closed reason union does not have to grow with every new adapter detail.
 *
 * | reason | owner layer |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `paused(route_unavailable)` | model routing / provider config |
 * | `paused(verifier_unavailable)` | provider call (transient; retry) |
 * | `paused(verifier_timeout)` | verifier latency vs. the configured cap |
 * | `paused(verifier_protocol)` | verifier prompt / verdict contract |
 * | `paused(verifier_runtime)` | host subagent runtime |
 * | `paused(verifier_budget)` | verifier child's configured execution cap |
 * | `paused(verifier_capability)` | readonly guard / tool catalog |
 * | `paused(verifier_aborted)` | host lifecycle — not a defect |
